Project #5
ECPE 177

Tested project with:
	1. Dr. Shafer
	
Any bugs found/fixed:
	1. client.py
		a. When testing TEXT messages, username fields appeared to be corrupted.
		   After discussing the issue with Dr. Shafer, we came to the conclusion
		   my client was designed to obtain the username header from a hardcoded
		   position, instead of searching for the field with the username header
		   initially. However, JOIN and LEAVE messages function correctly.
	2. server.py
		a. Also had issues with sending TEXT messages, as the client's local copy
		   of their message would appear on the GUI, as well as the server's copy.
		   This is obviously an issue, because a client should not have to see their
		   single message multiple times. I suspect this issue is closely related to
		   hardcoding the username field to a specific section of the TEXT message,
		   rather than parsing the message to find the username header.
		b. I also had an issue with clients leaving the chat rooom. When a client
		   leaves, the server crashes. In order for a client to leave the chat room,
		   I was simply closing the GUI window. To investigate the issue, I printed the
		   incoming data off recv(), on line 47. When I closed the GUI window, there was
		   a zero-length message recv()'d. Specifically, I printed the data as such:
		   
		   	print (str(raw_bytes))
		   	
		   which resulted in:
		   
		   	b''
		   	
		   Of course, the "b" symbolizes the string is in bytes, as the data had not been
		   properly converted to an ascii string yet. This leads me to believe Dr. Shafer
		   had a different way to exit the chat room that I am not aware of. In my own
		   client script, whenever I detect the GUI window closes, I send a LEAVE message
		   to the server, then exit the program. Being the server does not receive this
		   message, the server does not remove the socket from the socket list, and continues
		   to try and send to it. Hence, it crashes.
