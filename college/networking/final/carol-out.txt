Bob: Beats down their swords

Bob: 

Bob: Enter TYBALT

Bob: 

Bob: TYBALT

Bob: What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?

Bob: Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,

Bob: Or manage it to part these men with me.

Bob: TYBALT

Bob: What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,

Bob: As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:

Bob: Have at thee, coward!

Bob: They fight

Bob: 

Bob: Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

Bob: 

Bob: First Citizen

Bob: Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!

Bob: Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

Bob: Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

Bob: 

Bob: CAPULET

Bob: What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

Bob: LADY CAPULET

Bob: A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

Bob: CAPULET

Bob: My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,

Bob: And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

Bob: 

Bob: MONTAGUE

Bob: Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

Bob: LADY MONTAGUE

Bob: Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

Bob: Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

Bob: 

Bob: PRINCE

Bob: Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,

Bob: Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--

Bob: Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,

Bob: That quench the fire of your pernicious rage

Bob: With purple fountains issuing from your veins,

Bob: On pain of torture, from those bloody hands

Bob: Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,

Bob: And hear the sentence of your moved prince.

Bob: Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,

Bob: By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,

Bob: Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,

Bob: And made Verona's ancient citizens

Bob: Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,

Bob: To wield old partisans, in hands as old,

Bob: Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:

Bob: If ever you disturb our streets again,

Bob: Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.

Bob: For this time, all the rest depart away:

Bob: You Capulet; shall go along with me:

Bob: And, Montague, come you this afternoon,

Bob: To know our further pleasure in this case,

Bob: To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.

Bob: Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

Bob: Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

Bob: 

Bob: MONTAGUE

Bob: Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?

Bob: Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: Here were the servants of your adversary,

Bob: And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:

Bob: I drew to part them: in the instant came

Bob: The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,

Bob: Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,

Bob: He swung about his head and cut the winds,

Bob: Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:

Bob: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,

Bob: Came more and more and fought on part and part,

Bob: Till the prince came, who parted either part.

Bob: LADY MONTAGUE

Bob: O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?

Bob: Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun

Bob: Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,

Bob: A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;

Bob: Where, underneath the grove of sycamore

Bob: That westward rooteth from the city's side,

Bob: So early walking did I see your son:

Bob: Towards him I made, but he was ware of me

Bob: And stole into the covert of the wood:

Bob: I, measuring his affections by my own,

Bob: That most are busied when they're most alone,

Bob: Pursued my humour not pursuing his,

Bob: And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

Bob: MONTAGUE

Bob: Many a morning hath he there been seen,

Bob: With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.

Bob: Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;

Bob: But all so soon as the all-cheering sun

Bob: Should in the furthest east begin to draw

Bob: The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,

Bob: Away from the light steals home my heavy son,

Bob: And private in his chamber pens himself,

Bob: Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out

Bob: And makes himself an artificial night:

Bob: Black and portentous must this humour prove,

Bob: Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

Bob: MONTAGUE

Bob: I neither know it nor can learn of him.

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: Have you importuned him by any means?

Bob: MONTAGUE

Bob: Both by myself and many other friends:

Bob: But he, his own affections' counsellor,

Bob: Is to himself--I will not say how true--

Bob: But to himself so secret and so close,

Bob: So far from sounding and discovery,

Bob: As is the bud bit with an envious worm,

Bob: Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,

Bob: Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.

Bob: Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.

Bob: We would as willingly give cure as know.

Bob: Enter ROMEO

Bob: 

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;

Bob: I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

Bob: MONTAGUE

Bob: I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,

Bob: To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

Bob: Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

Bob: 

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: Good-morrow, cousin.

Bob: ROMEO

Bob: Is the day so young?

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: But new struck nine.

Bob: ROMEO

Bob: Ay me! sad hours seem long.

Bob: Was that my father that went hence so fast?

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

Bob: ROMEO

Bob: Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: In love?

Bob: ROMEO

Bob: Out--

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: Of love?

Bob: ROMEO

Bob: Out of her favour, where I am in love.

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,

Bob: Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

Bob: ROMEO

Bob: Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,

Bob: Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!

Bob: Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?

Bob: Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.

Bob: Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.

Bob: Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!

Bob: O any thing, of nothing first create!

Bob: O heavy lightness! serious vanity!

Bob: Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

Bob: Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,

Bob: sick health!

Bob: Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!

Bob: This love feel I, that feel no love in this.

Bob: Dost thou not laugh?

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: No, coz, I rather weep.

Bob: ROMEO

Bob: Good heart, at what?

Bob: BENVOLIO

Bob: At thy good heart's oppression.

Bob: ROMEO

Bob: Why, such is love's transgression.

Bob: Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,

Bob: Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest

Bob: With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown

Bob: Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.

Bob: Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;

Bob: Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;

Bob: Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
