Carol: Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU

Carol: 

Carol: HELENA

Carol: O, were that all! I think not on my father;

Carol: And these great tears grace his remembrance more

Carol: Than those I shed for him. What was he like?

Carol: I have forgot him: my imagination

Carol: Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.

Carol: I am undone: there is no living, none,

Carol: If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one

Carol: That I should love a bright particular star

Carol: And think to wed it, he is so above me:

Carol: In his bright radiance and collateral light

Carol: Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.

Carol: The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:

Carol: The hind that would be mated by the lion

Carol: Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,

Carol: To see him every hour; to sit and draw

Carol: His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,

Carol: In our heart's table; heart too capable

Carol: Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:

Carol: But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy

Carol: Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?

Carol: Enter PAROLLES

Carol: 

Carol: Aside

Carol: 

Carol: One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;

Carol: And yet I know him a notorious liar,

Carol: Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;

Carol: Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,

Carol: That they take place, when virtue's steely bones

Carol: Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see

Carol: Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Save you, fair queen!

Carol: HELENA

Carol: And you, monarch!

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: No.

Carol: HELENA

Carol: And no.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Are you meditating on virginity?

Carol: HELENA

Carol: Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me

Carol: ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how

Carol: may we barricado it against him?

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Keep him out.

Carol: HELENA

Carol: But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,

Carol: in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some

Carol: warlike resistance.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: There is none: man, sitting down before you, will

Carol: undermine you and blow you up.

Carol: HELENA

Carol: Bless our poor virginity from underminers and

Carol: blowers up! Is there no military policy, how

Carol: virgins might blow up men?

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be

Carol: blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with

Carol: the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It

Carol: is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to

Carol: preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational

Carol: increase and there was never virgin got till

Carol: virginity was first lost. That you were made of is

Carol: metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost

Carol: may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is

Carol: ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!

Carol: HELENA

Carol: I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the

Carol: rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,

Carol: is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible

Carol: disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:

Carol: virginity murders itself and should be buried in

Carol: highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate

Carol: offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,

Carol: much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very

Carol: paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.

Carol: Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of

Carol: self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the

Carol: canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose

Carol: by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make

Carol: itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the

Carol: principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!

Carol: HELENA

Carol: How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it

Carol: likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with

Carol: lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't

Carol: while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.

Carol: Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out

Carol: of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just

Carol: like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not

Carol: now. Your date is better in your pie and your

Carol: porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,

Carol: your old virginity, is like one of our French

Carol: withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,

Carol: 'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;

Carol: marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?

Carol: HELENA

Carol: Not my virginity yet [ ]

Carol: There shall your master have a thousand loves,

Carol: A mother and a mistress and a friend,

Carol: A phoenix, captain and an enemy,

Carol: A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,

Carol: A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;

Carol: His humble ambition, proud humility,

Carol: His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,

Carol: His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world

Carol: Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,

Carol: That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--

Carol: I know not what he shall. God send him well!

Carol: The court's a learning place, and he is one--

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: What one, i' faith?

Carol: HELENA

Carol: That I wish well. 'Tis pity--

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: What's pity?

Carol: HELENA

Carol: That wishing well had not a body in't,

Carol: Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,

Carol: Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,

Carol: Might with effects of them follow our friends,

Carol: And show what we alone must think, which never

Carol: Return us thanks.

Carol: Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

Carol: Exit

Carol: 

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I

Carol: will think of thee at court.

Carol: HELENA

Carol: Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Under Mars, I.

Carol: HELENA

Carol: I especially think, under Mars.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Why under Mars?

Carol: HELENA

Carol: The wars have so kept you under that you must needs

Carol: be born under Mars.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: When he was predominant.

Carol: HELENA

Carol: When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: Why think you so?

Carol: HELENA

Carol: You go so much backward when you fight.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: That's for advantage.

Carol: HELENA

Carol: So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;

Carol: but the composition that your valour and fear makes

Carol: in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

Carol: PAROLLES

Carol: I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee

Carol: acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the

Carol: which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize

Carol: thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's

Carol: counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon

Carol: thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and

Carol: thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When

Carol: thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast

Carol: none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,

Carol: and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

Carol: Exit

Carol: 

Carol: HELENA

Carol: Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,

Carol: Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky

Carol: Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull

Carol: Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.

Carol: What power is it which mounts my love so high,

Carol: That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?

Carol: The mightiest space in fortune nature brings

Carol: To join like likes and kiss like native things.

Carol: Impossible be strange attempts to those

Carol: That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose

Carol: What hath been cannot be: who ever strove

Carol: So show her merit, that did miss her love?

Carol: The king's disease--my project may deceive me,

Carol: But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

Carol: Exit
