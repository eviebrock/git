Design Choices:



We chose to design a Moore FSM for our ALU. We chose this design because it is easier to create, and debug.
Because we chose a Moore, our output only depends on the present state, rather than present state and input.
Designing a Mealy FSM would create one more possible situation for error, output during input. Because we
did not want an extra case for error during debugging, we chose a Moore FSM.
