Students should be able to:
-	From a problem statement:
        o	Design a state diagram
        o	Outline the associated state table
        o	Develop a state assignment table based on minimal or one-hot encoding
        o	Write behavioral VHDL implementing the state diagram using either minimal or one-hot
-	From VHDL:
        o	Outline the associated state table
        o	Design the associated state diagram
-	Explain the difference between Mealy and Moore FSMs as well as the design trade-offs between them
-	Explain the advantages and disadvantages of one-hot encoding
